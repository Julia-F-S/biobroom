Package: biobroom
Title: Turn Bioconductor objects into tidy data frames
Version: 0.99.0
Author: David G. Robinson, Andrew J. Bass, Emily Nelson and John D. Storey

Description: This package contains methods for converting standard objects constructed by bioinformatics packages, especially those in BioConductor, and converting them to tidy data. It thus serves as a complement to the broom package, and follows the same the tidy, augment, glance division of tidying methods. Tidying data makes it easy to recombine, reshape and visualize bioinformatics analyses.
